# Assignment 4 repo

All code and explanations are in the `assignment4.ipynb` file.

The path to the images is `./images`. It is relative because the absolute path is generated and printed in the jupyter notebook.

To the TA correcting this: I didn't need the points but still wanted to learn how to do all of this, so I just used libraries and linked an implementation online that helped me learn the innerworkings of the library. Sorry if that seems lazy, but I have a lot of assignments this week 😔️
