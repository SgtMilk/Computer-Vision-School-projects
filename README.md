# ECSE-415-projects
Hi! In the following folders are my assignments in the Introduction to Computer Vision class.

There were four assignments in this class and one project. The last assignment is incomplete (used libraries instead of implementing from scratch) because it was not worth any points.

Here are the different exercices in each assignment:

Assignment 1:
- Thresholding
- Denoising
- Sobel Edge Detector

Assignment 2:
- Harris Corner Detector
- Invariance of SIFT Features
    - Invariance Under Scale
    - Invariance Under Rotation
- Image Stitching
- Image Matching

Assignment 3:
- Preprocessing Data
- Eigenface Representation
- Classification
- Face Detection

Assignment 4:
- KMeans Segmentation
- Expectation Maximization Segmentation
- Mask-RCNN Segmentation

Project:
This was a team project, so I only kept here my contribution, for question 2, the deep learning regression part.

All instructions for each assignments are in their respective folders. I removed al virtual environments because to remove some clutter because this repo is for demonstration only.
